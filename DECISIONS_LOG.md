## Decision: aeon over sktime (28 May 2026)
Choice: aeon for time series data loading.
Alternatives considered: sktime, custom .ts parser.
Reasoning: aeon is the actively-maintained fork of sktime focused on TSC.
Lighter dependency footprint. APIs are nearly identical so swap cost
is low if needed for paper-repo compatibility later.
Risk: some older paper repos use sktime; will translate calls or
install both as needed.

## Decision: per-sample z-score normalisation (28 May 2026)
Choice: each ECG trace normalised against its own mean and std.
Alternatives considered: per-dataset z-scoring (fit stats on train, apply
to test); no normalisation.
Reasoning: UCR archive convention for time series classification, used by
most benchmarks on ECG200. Removes inter-recording baseline drift.
Avoids the train/test leakage concern of per-dataset scoring because
no statistics are fit from training data.
Note: visual difference on ECG200 specifically is small because the
UCR data appears already centred — but normalisation remains the
correct defensive default and is required for cross-paper comparability.
